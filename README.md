# dumbisa
Like the name suggests, a dumb ISA.

This project takes inspiration from the following sources:

https://felix.engineer/blogs/virtual-machine-in-c
https://github.com/felixangell/mac
A big-ass stack of papers about this project from 2 years ago.

I'd plan to have a decent bit of documentation, a proper VM, and maybe an assembler done.

Things I'm taking/changing:
I'm going to make a proper assembler and machine code instead of feeding the VM the pure opcode mnemonics, as outlined in the blog post.
I'm also going to "borrow" the idea of the top 2 stack values being used for addition instead of registers.



That's all for now, I'll add more later.
